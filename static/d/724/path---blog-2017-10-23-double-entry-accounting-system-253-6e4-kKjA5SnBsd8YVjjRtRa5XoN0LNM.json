It has been first  documented by Luca Pacioli in 1494 on his book entitled  “Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita”. From then it has been widely accepted as the most scientific accounting system. Before this system single entry accounting system was being used which is not a scientific method and has lots of disadvantages compared to double entry accounting system.</p>\n<p>The main concept of double entry accounting system is that every business transactions have at least two party or accounts. One party will provide the benefits while the other will take the benefits. The party that provides the benefits is called as debit and the party that receives the benefits is called as credit. That means for every transaction there will be one debit entry and one credit entry.</p>\n<p><strong>E.g.</strong> Suppose Mr. X buys some materials for his business from Mr. Y for cash of $1,000. This is a business transaction. It has two sides or accounts. In one side Mr. X is receiving the materials and on the other side he is loosing money. In double entry accounting system both sides will be recorded. In this case inventory account will be increased by $1,000 for receiving the materials at the same time cash account will be decreased by $1,000 for loosing the money.</p>\n<p>It is mandatory that every transaction should have at least two entries. Though the number of entry is not limited to two. In double entry system one entry will have effect on the debit side of the account and the other entry will have effect on the credit side of the account. Thus the account entries keeps the account equation in balance,</p>\n<p><strong><center>Assets = Liability + Owner’s Equity</center></strong></p>\n<p>To illustrates this more clearly recall the above example. On a single entry account system the transaction will be written as follow,</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-hover\">\n  <thead class=\"thead-dark\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <th>Revenues</th>\n    <th>Expenses</th>\n  </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tr>\n   <td>10 August, 2017</td>\n   <td>Purchase of raw materials.</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td class=\"text-right\">$1,000</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</br>\n<p>But on a double entry accounting system the transaction will be recorded as follow,</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-hover\">\n  <thead class=\"thead-dark\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date</th>\n    <th>Accounts</th>\n    <th class=\"text-center\">Debit</th>\n    <th class=\"text-center\">Credit</th>\n  </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tr>\n   <td>10 August, 2017</td>\n   <td>Inventory</td>\n   <td class=\"text-right\">$1,000</td>\n   <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>10 August, 2017</td>\n   <td>Cash</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td class=\"text-right\">$1,000</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</br>\n<p>A notation should be taken to indicate that this transaction is for purchasing of raw materials for the business.\nTraditionally the two effect of the transaction is termed as debit and credit. For every debit there will always be one and opposite credit with equal amount. That is the duality principle of accounting. Debit entry have the following effects,\nIncrease assets and expenses,\nDecrease liability, income and owner’s equity.\nAnd the credit entry will have the following effects,\nIncrease liability, income and owner’s equity,\nDecrease assets and expenses.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advantages\"><a href=\"#advantages\" aria-label=\"advantages permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Advantages</h4>\n<p>Under double entry accounting system the two aspects of each transactions are recorded.
