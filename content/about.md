Hello, my name is Nahidur Rahman, and I am a dedicated Software Engineer hailing from Bangladesh. With a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, I have been professionally engaged in the field of software development since 2015.

Over the course of my career, I have honed my expertise in backend development, specializing in Python and its frameworks, including Django and Flask. These tools have allowed me to build robust and scalable applications across a variety of industries. Recently, I have taken the initiative to expand my skill set by learning Golang, as I believe continuous learning is key to staying relevant in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

In terms of academic qualifications, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, which provided me with a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving. Additionally, I have earned a Master’s degree in Information Technology, further enriching my technical knowledge and perspective on modern technological trends.

When I am not coding or exploring new technologies, I like to spend my leisure time engaging in activities that stimulate my mind and expand my horizons. Reading books is one of my favorite pastimes, as it allows me to learn about a wide range of topics, both technical and non-technical. I also enjoy watching educational YouTube tutorials, which serve as a valuable resource for staying updated on emerging tools, frameworks, and best practices in software engineering.

If you would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to reach out via email at nahidsaikatft40@gmail.com. I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, collaborating on exciting projects, or exploring new opportunities.
