## Single Entry Bookkeeping
A single entry bookkeeping is an accounting system that records only one entry for a transaction to the accounting records. The core information that single entry bookkeeping records is cash receipts and cash disbursements. Assets and liabilities needs to maintain separately in single entry bookkeeping.

But when business grows and has a lot of information to maintain then it is better to move to double entry bookkeeping system as it can handle large amount of data providing advance reporting facilities.

## Cashbook
In a single entry bookkeeping system transactions are recorded in cashbook. For every transaction there should be one entry in cashbook. Cashbook has different columns to record the transactions in each rows.

* Date: This is the date of the transactions,
* Description: A short description about the transactions,
* Income/Expenses: The amount of the transactions,
* Balance: Summed up the amounts of all transactions.

The first entry of a single entry bookkeeping is the balance of the accounting period. Then all the transactions are recorded in each row. Last line of the cashbook is the closing balance of the accounting period. A typical cashbook of any business is below.
