## S – Single Responsibility Principle
A class or module should have one and only one reason to change.
## O – Open Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
## L – Liskov Substitution Principle
Functions that use references of base classes must be able to use objects of the derived class without knowing it.
## I – Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
## D – Dependency Inversion Principle
=> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

=> Abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions.
