We all know that India has adapted with new tax system called GST (Goods & Services Tax) from 1st July, 2017. This is a consolidated tax system where Indian Government combine many of their Central and State tax on products and services. India has accepted this new tax system because it has many advantages. It will cause the product/service prices to reduce. Thus Indian consumer will be benefited. Not only that India will be more competitive in International market for cost reduction nature of the new system. One question comes in mind how GST will reduce products/services cost? Well, before GST there are many tax on products/services that had been levied by State as well as Central Government. And also there was not any credit mechanism of already paid tax. Thus it may happen that one product/service has been levied for more than once by State or Center. So it increase the cost. In GST, business entities can take the credit of tax they have already paid. So product/service prices are remaining low.

Now come to the topic of this post. What is Reverse Charge Mechanism? We can not directly jump to the topic without mentioning some rules and regulation of GST. In GST system any business entity having annual turnover of more than Rs 20 lakh have to register in GSTN. After registration they will have GSTIN. GSTIN is a 15 digits number comprising state code, PAN number, entity code and a check sum digit. GSTIN is the key by which Government will identify the business entities all over India. Through GSTIN Government can identify the business entity and collect tax. But what about the business whose annual turnover is less than Rs 20 lakh. In India this kind on entity is huge and they participate approximately half of the national GDP. So a huge number of entity will be outside of the GST system. Thus Government will loss an huge amount of tax revenue. To collect tax from those entities Indian Government thoughts a way and Reverse Charge Mechanism comes in.

Then what is the concept of RCM. At this point any transaction between two registered entity have to pay GST. But when a transaction happening between a registered entity and an unregistered entity where unregistered entity is the vendor, instead of paying GST to the vendor the registered entity by itself will be  liable to pay GST of itself to Government. That means The registered entity will collect GST from itself as a vendor and pay to Government. In this kind of transaction the liability of GST payment is being reverse to the registered customer. So we call it reverse charge mechanism. Here we need to mention an important thing and that is the registered customer who pay GST in reverse charge can also take credit of it. As every other inword transaction the customer needs to mention it in GSTR-2 and after filing GSTR-3 can take input tax credit of this transaction. One condition to treat a transaction in reverse charge mechanism is that the vendor must be unregistered and the customer must be registered. Indian Government have fixed 12 services that should be treat in reverse charge mechanism no mater if the vendor is registered or not. But in case of goods if vendor is unregistered reverse charge will apply. In the tax invoice of reverse charge transactions it needs to be mentioned that this transaction is under reverse charge.
